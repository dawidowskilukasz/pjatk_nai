## Neural Networks

#### Installation:

Assuming that you have pip installed, type this in a terminal:  
```sudo pip install tensorflow``` (with regard to creating neural networks [“NN”] models),  
```sudo pip install opencv-python``` (with regard of working with camera video),  
```sudo pip install mediapipe``` (with regard to work with created detection models (hand landmark detection)),  
and ```sudo pip install pyautogui``` (with regard to work with system elements (mouse, keyboard etc.)) 


#### Overview:

A program using hand landmark detection in order to move in cursor and do basic tasks.

It was made with a though about controlling the browser so there are specific gestures to work your way in browsers
